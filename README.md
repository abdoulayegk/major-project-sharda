Abstract:
The term Financial Inclusion is not just a word but a concrete action to build a better world and It has become the most important aspect 
for the developmentof nations.  The economy in Africa faces significant challenges that affect development and livelihood. One of the 
challenges is holding a bank account in Africa, indicating the person's stable economic status. There is a need to solve and find solutions 
to the banking problems in Africa. A huge number of people still do not have a bank account compared to those who have and this contributes 
to the decline of Africa's economy. Therefore, in this paper, we implemented robust machine learning techniques to predict how likely a person 
has a bank account or not. Our aim was to use advanced machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost and Adaboost classifiers. 
We also applied oversampling and standardization techniques on the data to solve problems of unbalanced classes. The dataset is an open data 
available on the Zindi platform. Finally, the results show that lightGBM performs better using f1-score, accuracy, precision, recall and roc score
metrics which is 91.498%, 91.321%, 92.783%, 90%247%, and 91.568% respectively.
